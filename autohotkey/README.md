# autohotkey

Here is my autohotkey configuration which provides some convenience for working on a Windows system. It provides as much of the shortcuts listet [here](/shortcuts.md) as possible.

## Install

Install via:

```PowerShell
choco install -y autohotkey
```

(Or download if from https://autohotkey.com/download/)
