# My X keyboard extension configuration

I highly customized my keyboard layout for optimal efficiency and ergonomic. It is a mix between the default German QWERTZ (which I was used to) and the awesome [Neo2] layout. I decided to mix these two layouts because I could not force myself to entirely switch to [Neo2] and because I wanted to be able to shortly use other systems without more pain than necessary.

## Xmodmap
I started with a `.Xmodmap` file and it did almost everything what I wanted but certain things could not be accomplished with `xmodmap`:

* Settings like producing the symbol '0' with:

  ```
  <Alt Gr> + <space>
  ```

  did not work.
* Xmodmap settings where reset when switching to another virtual consoles.
* No easy and/or fast way to switch to the normal QWERTZ layout (the `xmodmap` command usually took itâ€˜s 5 seconds to terminate).
* Could only be used when logged in not before (I had to remember if my settings where already in effect when typing in passwords).

So I decided to implement my layout using xkb.

## xkb

I just modified the original neo definition in the de symbols file.

To use my modified version just run the deploy script as root:

```Shell
./deploy
```

Then either enable 'German (Neo 2)' in your window manager (for example Gnome 3) or run `./enable` (in as normal user).

After enabling it, your default keyboard layout will be [Neo2] with the QWERTZ layout. The Gnome keyboard tool can show you the mapping for all keys. Also the program [NeoLayoutViewer] can be used to quickly look up the [Neo2] layout.

Note that you can switch to the normal layout (as specified in the keyboard file) with the [scroll lock key](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scroll_lock) or with tools your window manager provides.

## Autohotkey on M$ Windows

The option to use the higher layers of Neo2 combined with the default QWERTZ layout is actually supported by [NeoVars](https://wiki.neo-layout.org/wiki/Neo%20unter%20Windows%20einrichten/NeoVars) under Windows which is pretty nice. All you have to do to get it is to create a INI file under `%APPDATA%\Neo2\Neo2.ini` with the content of [this file](/qNeo2/Neo2.ini) and download [neo20.exe](https://github.com/neo-layout/neo-layout/raw/master/windows/neo-vars/out/neo20.exe) and start it.

* Tested on Windows 7

### Problems

* Does not work in the default Powershell terminal emulator. When working with that the keyboard layout is "reverted" to the default one. When switching windows qNeo2 is automatically enabled back. There needs to be a replacement Powershell terminal emulator which does not fool around with me here.

* Some other quirks

### Legacy

On older systems you might need the current version of the [Neo2] xkb files before copying over the de file. See [the Wiki page about installing Neo2](http://wiki.neo-layout.org/wiki/Neo%20unter%20Linux%20einrichten/xkbmap).
