# autohotkey

Here is my autohotkey configuration which provides some convenience for working on a Windows system. It provides as much of the shortcuts listed in my [shortcuts docs](/shortcuts.md) as possible.

## Install

Install via:

```dosbatch
choco install -y autohotkey
```

(Or download if from https://autohotkey.com/download/)

## Usage

Start individually. Using the neo20.exe (build from neo-vars) seems not to include the custom.ahk.
